MGMT6963 Materials and Vitual Machine Readme
=====

#The root password for the Ubuntu virtual machine and the MySQL database is `password`.

You should find that it doesn't function much differently from a windows machine but there are quirks. Learning to work with new technologies is a fundamental skill we will be developing for the course.

Technology Fundamentals for Analytics (MGMT-6963) Course Materials. 

The course materials for the class are located in */home/analytics/MGMT6963*.  It is also available on github [https://github.com/jkuruzovich/MGMT6963](https://github.com/jkuruzovich/MGMT6963). I'm still transitioning but my goal is to get the course labs and eventually all presentations written in markdown.

 The use of a common virtual machine is designed to facilitate exercise in the class and deal with complexities introduced by different operating systems.  For example, last year we found that several different R packages will have different behaviors based on the operating system.

When working through exercises, always make sure that you have the most recent copy. To update this repository on the virtual machine, execute the following commands in terminal:
```commands
cd /home/analytics/MGMT6963
git pull
```
