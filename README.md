Technology Fundamentals for Analytics (MGMT-6963) Course Materials. 

These are the most recent course materials for the Technology Fundamentals for Analytics course.

This git repository will be installed on the Ubuntu virtual machine image provided in class. The use of a common virtual machine is designed to facilitate exercise in the class and deal with complexities introduced by different operating systems.  For example, last year we found that several different R packages will have different behaviors based on the operating system.

When working through exercises, always make sure that you have the most recent copy. To update this repository on the virtual machine, execute the following commands in terminal:
```commands
cd /home/analytics/MGMT6963
git pull
```
