#Relational Databases
"A relational database is a database that stores information about both the data and how it is related. "In relational structuring, all data and relationships are represented in flat, two-dimensional table called a relation."[1] For example, organizations often want to store and retrieve information about people, where they are located and how to contact them. Often many people live or work at a variety of addresses. So, recording and retrieving them becomes importantâ€”relational databases are good for supporting these kinds of applications."
