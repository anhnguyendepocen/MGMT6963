Random acts of pizza - a Kaggle competition
=====

This is the code I have used for the Kaggle not-for-prize competition [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/random-acts-of-pizza). The code landed me at No. 13 (out of 110 currently). My methodology is explained in the blog post [here](http://www.runzemc.com/2014/08/random-acts-of-pizza.html).

The data are not included and can be downloaded from the competition [website](https://www.kaggle.com/c/random-acts-of-pizza/data) directly.

Now who's going to buy me a pizza? :-)
